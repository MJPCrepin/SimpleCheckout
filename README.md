# SimpleCheckout

Basic shopping cart/checkout system to get final price of cart filled with items from list.
Prices are taken from an inventory of legal items.
Program class includes tests. List passed as an array of strings.

Suggested improvements:
- Extract inventory input (legal items)
- Unit testing (having issues with my VS install)
